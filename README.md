# What is ParkSense?

Leveraging real-time computer vision on the edge, ParkSense provides real-time parking lot capacity tracking for campus, sporting events, retail, and many other parking lot settings.

We developed ParkSense using the [ESP32s3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ESP32S3-p-5627.html?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9IayBhBJEiwAVuc3fjy7BQsDdvPK5KJzw_hz1yBiIKzPyLZ91Xxr-qeByd02p219zY0WAhoCu1kQAvD_BwE) and specialize our car detection/localization tasks on top of [MobileNetv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).

We currently provide a web-based frontend, developed in [React](https://react.dev/).
